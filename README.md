# corebird
Native Twitter client, built with Gtk3. You need 2 packages from kcp:

1-rest
```
kcp -di rest
```
2-libgstgtkskin (for video support):
```
kcp -di libgstgtkskin
```
**For better look-and-feel you need to enable the Breeze icon theme on the GTK application settings, in both primary and backend mode.**
